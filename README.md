### Hi!

I am a backend developer with 6 years of experience in Node.js and TypeScript, primarily responsible for API development and database design. I have extensive experience operating and developing services based on monolithic architectures and am skilled in monitoring, incident response, and debugging. To ensure service stability and consistency, I regularly write unit and end-to-end tests using tools such as Jest and Supertest. Currently, I am preparing for a new chapter in Toronto and seeking an opportunity to contribute my experience and skills to a forward-thinking company.
